### 🎯 The Mission
After a high-intensity period of leading nationwide AI workshops for teachers, I faced a 10kg weight gain due to constant travel. This project is my personal "Emergency Break." It is the **digital transformation** of my manual, handwritten weight loss logs from a successful "Halving" challenge in 2023 into a modern, tactical cloud dashboard.

### 🚀 Journey & Vibe Coding
My journey started in 2023 with image generation in Midjourney. By 2025, I progressed into advanced AI tools for professional education. This app was built during the AI Hackathon Hamburg using a full **Vibe Coding** workflow:
* **AI Architecture:** Prompt Design & Gem Development in **Google AI Studio (Gemini)**.
* **Backend:** Real-time data sync via **Firebase Firestore**.
* **Frontend:** Mobile-first tactical UI using Tailwind CSS and Chart.js.

### ✨ Tactical Features
* **Mission Roadmap:** Strategic milestones based on 2023 historical data (Target: 76kg).
* **Fatburn Schedule:** "Tactical Tuesday" logic to ensure long-term consistency.
* **Physiology Navigator:** Real-time BMI and zone-distance tracking.
* **Combat Log:** Direct mobile cloud-sync for weight and activity metrics.
